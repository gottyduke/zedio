Zedio is an event-driven header library for writing asynchronous applications in C++:

+ Multithreaded, work-stealing based task scheduler. (reference [tokio](https://tokio.rs/))
+ Proactor event handling backed by [io_uring](https://github.com/axboe/liburing).
+ Asynchronous TCP and UDP sockets.

It's being developed, if you're interested in zedio and want to participate in its development, see [contributing](contributing)
